With the aim to make life easier for investors , we have come up with an easy to understand and use stock predictor!!
The "MarketMinds"!!
This project solely aims in creating a stock predictor that provides valuable insights and helps investors in decision-making.

A stock predictor is a tool or system that uses data analysis, machine learning, and various techniques to forecast stock prices and market trends. These models use historical stock price data, trading volume, and potentially other relevant factors to forecast the future price or behavior of a particular stock or the broader stock market.

Stock predictors are primarily used by investors, traders, financial analysts, and institutions to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding stocks. The main goal of using a stock predictor is to gain an edge in the financial markets by making predictions about which stocks are likely to perform well and which ones may underperform.
